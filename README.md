## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

The main agenda of this project is to provide a more concrete, trustworthy and better security of people living in housing societies.
A simple website which allows you to know when, where, who and with what purpose a person is entering or leaving the society’s premises. All these facilities are available at one’s fingertips.

## Getting Started

Get started with three simple steps

### Prerequisites

Softwares you
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the project
   ```JS
   npm run
   ```

## Usage

This website allows you to keep track of each person entering who has an acquaintance with you or not. This website gives you the control to allow or deny the entry of a person under your name.
For better understanding, let us say that you live in A block in flat number 101. Suppose there comes a delivery boy from a courier company claiming that he has got your parcel. So the gatekeeper would drop you a message regarding the same and there you would be given options whether to allow or not. 

There would be a unique id for each member. There will also be two types of IDs viz. one for the gatekeeper (admin) and the other for users (society members). There is also a feature where the guard is aware of your in/out status all the time i.e. whether you are available to attend the guest or not.
